# Introduction
--Big shoutouts to Patrick (CL!) for keeping it real and Gregory (DAppU) for the tutorials
--This was written "from scratch" in one day, using all the knowledge, skills, and stress from the hackathon
--I spent days in the docs, much love to the docs : @Chainlink, @OpenZeppelin, @Solidity
--Cryptozombies Chapter 2 almost finished!
--Unfinished front-end proof-of-contract is here https://oneclickdapp.com/wisdom-context ! (oneclickdapp!)
--145 Pages of development docs (100% serious look at the png in folder)
--Connect to wallet, mint a possibly burnable erc721 NFTNote
--Eventually, we string the notes together into a song
--Song can be its own thing, on a marketplace
--Basically, the Hackathon Project is myself
--Overcoming bugs, confusion, tutorial purgatory, self-doubt
--almost 10 gigs of random files created from installing dependencies
--I want to be on a team next time!  I have tons of ideas but working alone can be crushing when you are a beginner.
--I wanted this to be a crazy recursive educational inspirational metaphorical game but alas I am only one man with a very busy wingbird Agile Coach cheering me on (thanks Lady Leopard!)

# Super Simply Put: NFTnote.eth
Connect to wallet (coin in), "name your note", sends in to contract and recieves an NFT "note!". 
Each person has one "string note" struct in the blockchain storage.  The d&d inspired stats are used to determine
velocity, vibrato, duration, and more (6 stats!)
By limiting the number of notes per song, and scaling the app to let them generate as many number of notes as they want for the money.

# The Original Idea! Captain-Circuits-OTC-
Captain Circuits(OTC) is inheriting chainlink hackathon team efforts to set the foundations.  Our teamname __________, like this concept, is a consensus of our validators. Input from our Characters Background produced a living chain of focused moments from our united goal!

Step-by-step and hash-by-hash this no-fun-tokenventure will not surprise you with hidden features (yes it will!), so sometimes you might have to fill in the __________. 

In order to minimize the flavor, here is a no-nonsense monkeys-on-typewriters introduction to the your first team: 

Tippi Fifestar (the Tank): He plods away, very slowly moving through the inevitable beginner stage.  Enjoys climbing mountains and playing the blockchain banjo.
Captain Circuits (The Wizard): Known for his infinite song algorithm and intermediate coding level, Captain craves another chance at conducting blockchain orchestra with you! If only you can complete the challenges!
_________________ (The ninja): Not much is known about this one, but her agility and visualization ability kept us focused on the goal: 

The goal!

  Imagine you put one coin in and some simple challenges later you are part owner of the next smash hit!?! 
    Step 1: Coin arcade (investment phase)
    Step 2: Choose advantages/Characters (seed phrase)
    Step 3: Get Funkiness (proof page)
    Step 4: Choose ear (press play)
Share and vote (the tippi point) coming soon!

brought to you by deadlines and Patricks Pizza

our goals:
no-fun-tokens exchanged for real random results (RRR)
decentralize song composition, ownership, distribution, and dancing
transparency from the circuits to the chain
