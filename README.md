Captain Circuits(OTC) is inheriting chainlink hackathon team efforts to set the foundations.  Our teamname __________, like this concept, is a consensus of our validators. Input from our Characters Background produced a living chain of focused moments from our united goal!

Step-by-step and hash-by-hash this no-fun-tokenventure will not surprise you with hidden features (yes it will!), so sometimes you might have to fill in the __________.

Tippi Fifestar (the Tank): He plods away, very slowly moving through the inevitable beginner stage.  Enjoys climbing mountains and playing the blockchain banjo.
Captain Circuits (The Wizard): Known for his infinite song algorithm and intermediate coding level, Captain craves another chance at conducting blockchain orchestra with you! If only you can complete the challenges!
_________________ (The ninja): Not much is known about this one, but her agility and visualization ability kept us focused on the goal: 

The goal!

  Imagine you put one coin in and some simple challenges later you are part owner of the next smash hit!?!

    Step 2: Choose advantages/Characters (seed phrase)
    Step 3: Get Funkiness (proof page)
    Step 4: Choose ear (press play)
Share and vote (the tippi point) coming soon!

brought to you by deadlines and Patricks Pizza

our goals:

decentralize song composition, ownership, distribution, and dancing
transparency from the circuits to the chain
